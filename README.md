# Testing spell checkers

This repo contains the experiments on various available spell checkers. The code is optimised for Colab (with various tweaks I had to include).

* [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BfqkPXG4wJbbDIkBM9FCiJzVi0Z3hfAF?usp=sharing) with the sequence of commands to rerpoduce the experiments.
* [Report](https://github.com/kategerasimenko/spell_checkers/blob/main/Spell_checkers.pdf) which describes the data, tools, experimental setup, results, and challenges I faced.
